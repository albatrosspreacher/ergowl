# Ergowl

With the pervasive integration of technology in daily life, a pressing need arises for advancements in the domain of ergonomics. Prolonged slouching, commonly observed when using devices such as smartphones and laptops, often leads to discomfort and pain in the back and neck regions, potentially exacerbating and precipitating further health issues. This research endeavors to address this issue through the paradigm of Ubiquitous Computing by proposing the development of Ergowl â€” a non-intrusive assistive headphone attachment capable of prompting users to correct their posture. Ergowl will incorporate interactive features aimed at guiding users in adopting posture-friendly practices to mitigate the risk of health complications associated with poor posture.
